# Repo sub-directory mgiration example

Use this to take a look at how git-history is affected by migrating the contents of a repository into a sub-directory.

You can use `blame` and (locally) `git log --follow` to view the history for a specific file. However, Githubs 'history' option only offers the history of the migration and any post-migration changes.

Locally, `blame` built into VSCode also works.
